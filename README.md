# Portfolio-website
This is a simple portfolio website I created using HTML and basic CSS as a beginner project. The website has two pages: Home and Contact. The Home page gives a brief introduction about me, and the Contact page is included to make it easy to reach out.

What I focused on:

Writing clean HTML structure

Using basic CSS for layout and styling

Linking multiple pages together

Keeping the design simple and readable

This project helped me understand the basics of building a multi-page website and improved my confidence with HTML and CSS.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!
